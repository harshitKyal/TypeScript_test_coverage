## Problem

You work for Implausible Burger, a chain
of burger restaurants specialising in incredibly authentic, cardboard based burger patties.
The CEO of Implausible Burger is keen to know how the portfolio of stores performed in January when people
crave for cardboard based patties.

Given the attached JSON data of Implausible Burger sales
figures, calculate the following:

1. The total sales reported by the flagship store in Chadstone
2. The centre where we took the most sales
3. The total sales reported by stores in Victoria
4. The store with the highest sales PSM *

* Sales Per Square Metre (PSM) is the total sales divided by the store
  area  - a standard means of comparing stores of differing sizes

## Guidelines

1. Write a CLI app in TypeScript
2. Take as much time as you need, though you shouldn't need more than an hour or two.
3. Do not upload your solution to a public repository on GitHub. Instead email us a zip file.
